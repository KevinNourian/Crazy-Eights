Rules for Crazy Eights Card Game

Objective:
Be the first player to get rid of all cards in your hand.
Multiple rounds are played and scores are kept. The player with the lowest total score when another player gets a total score of 100 points or more is the winner.

Dealing cards:
1. A standard 52 card deck gets Shuffled.
2. 2 players can play.
3. 7 cards are dealt to each player one at a time.
4. The remaining deck is called the Draw Deck.
5. The top card of the Draw Deck is placed face up to start the Discard Pile.
6. 8 cannot be the first card to start the discard pile. If an 8 appears, the program will choose a location in the Draw Deck at random, will place the card there, and will choose the next card from the top.

The Game:
1. Cards with matching suit or matching number can be placed in the Discard Pile.
2. The player is shown which cards he/she can play and must choose one of those cards.
3. If a player does not have a card with the same suit or same number as the card in the Discard Pile, the player will choose up to 3 cards from the top of the Draw Deck. If none of the cards can be played, the player will lose the turn.
4. If the player draws a card that can be played, the player must play that card.
5. 8 is the wildcard and can be played on any card.
6. The round ends when a player places the last card in his/her hand in the Discard Pile.
7. If the Draw Deck is gone and a player cannot play, the player will lose the turn. If every player cannot play, the round is over and each player gets the value of their un-played cards.
8. The player chooses the card to play by indicating a number. The first card in the list is card number 1.
9. Failure to choose one of the cards in the Can Play list will result in the player losing the turn.


Scoring:
1. Players get the value of cards left in their hand at the end of a round.
