# Crazy Eights

## Description
This program mimics the two-player card game, Crazy Eights.

## Rules
* The objective is to be the first player to get rid of all cards in your hand. 
* Multiple rounds are played and scores are kept. 
* After playing multiple rounds, the player with the lowest total score when another player gets a total score of 100 points or more is the winner. 

## Execution
Run `Crazyeights.py`

## Notes
* When the game starts, the program asks for the players' names. After they enter their names, the game will refer to them by name only.
* At any point during the game, the player can type "--help" and be taken to a screen where they can read the rules of the game and instructions for how to play. They will resume the game when they close the window.
