# Crazy Eights
This program mimics the two-player card game, Crazy Eights. The objective is to be the first player to get rid of all cards in your hand. Multiple rounds are played and scores are kept. After playing multiple rounds, the player with the lowest total score when another player gets a total score of 100 points or more is the winner. 

When the game starts, the program asks for the players' names. After they enter their names, the game will refer to them by name only.

At any point during the game, the player can type "--help" and be taken to a screen where they can read the rules of the game and instructions for how to play. They will resume the game when they close the window.
